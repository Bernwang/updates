Work left to do:

Links to pull requests:

* Switched to doctr for deploying docs on Travis: https://github.com/cesium-ml/cesium/pull/216
* [WIP] Implement the walkthrough tutorial: https://github.com/cesium-ml/cesium_web/pull/138

I wish I could have contributed more to cesium but I spent quite a while recruiting this semester, which is a pity for me. But all in all, I really like the cesium team and I've learned a lot from everyone. Thanks for a great semester!
