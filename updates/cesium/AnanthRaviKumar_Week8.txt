Past Week:
    - almost finished implementation of DTW - DAG method 
    - finished implementing test cases for 4/6 methods.

Next week:
    - finish up DTW-DAG implementation.
    - time series clustering with Cesium
    - think of ways to make the DTW alg faster.

Challenges:
    - Having difficulty figuring out a way to systematically label nodes in networkx formulation. Using the value of a cell as the name of a node is not doable since networkx doesn't allow for multiple nodes with the same label.
