Past Week:
    > Submitted pull request to integrate coverage with travis.ci
    > added in tests to boost coverage of test_cadence_features and test_transform

Next week:
    > Continue improving test coverage, bump up at least one file to 100% coverage.
    > Read through the Cesium code in depth, figure out how the math behind it works.

Issues:
    > Code coverage can be misleading; some of the util files in particular have only ~70% coverage, but do not
    actually need more tests, since the methods not explicitly tested are often used in other test cases, which leads to coverage actually underestimating how much is being tested.
