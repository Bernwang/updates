## Past week

* Got cesium web running locally
* Researched about `react-joyride`

## This week

* Keep doing some experiments with `joyride`

## Issues

* Still have trouble creating a new model:
    ```
    bundle.js:44681 Cannot create model 'our model': ufunc 'isnan' not supported for the input types, and the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule ''safe''
    ```
