Past week:
    - Prototyped DAG-based partial as per this paper: http://knight.cis.temple.edu/~vasilis/Courses/CIS664/Papers/PKDD05.pdf

Current Week:
    - Find a time series to test cesium time-series clustering on.
    - Finish up implementation of DAG-based partial matching by:
        - writing test cases.
        - reading literature and seeing if there are any other partial matching methods
        that don't require computation of the entire cost matrix.

Challenges:
    - Nothing insurmountable.
