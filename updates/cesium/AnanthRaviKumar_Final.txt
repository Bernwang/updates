Work left to do:
    1) Finish the DTW implementation
    2) Add in the code coverage functionality, in particular the PR comment feature.
    3) Keep contributing to cesium! I'll add in both of the aforementioned after finals.

Links to pull requests:
    1) Improving test coverage: https://github.com/cesium-ml/cesium/pull/215
    2) Integrating coverage with Travis: https://github.com/cesium-ml/cesium/pull/211
    3) Updating the readme: https://github.com/cesium-ml/cesium/pull/207
    4) Updating model_selection: https://github.com/cesium-ml/cesium/pull/212
    5) [Work in Progress] DTW implementation: https://github.com/cesium-ml/cesium/pull/233

All in all I spent about 8-9 hours a week on average working on Cesium-related activities. Most of that time was spent reading documentation (for Travis CI, codecov and DTW implementations) and the existing code-base (for the readme), and the second largest chunk of time was spent writing actual code. The third significant chunk of time was spent reading through papers on Time series analysis and on dynamic time warping as a whole, to try to reconcile speed with cost in the DTW implementation.
