Past week: 
> I worked with Brett to get the cesium web running properly on my laptop (without using docker). I am also working on adding table creation to `tools/db_create.sh`. I was in Houston all last week for a conference, so I will be sure to get more done in this upcoming week.

Next week:
> I will work with somebody to add a home button to the website. After that, I will pick up another task.

Issues:
> None yet!
