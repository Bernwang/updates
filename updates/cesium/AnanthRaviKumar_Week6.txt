Past Week:
    - Read and understood background behind dynamic time warping.
    - Read through the FastDTW implementation and paper, also read through the R dtw repo's companion paper and repository.

Next Week:
    - Discuss FastDTW and R repository's functionality with Stefan, and see where to go from there.

Challenges:
    -  Having trouble with the codecoverage pull request; coverage docs aren't very clear, and I'm not sure if coverage needs to be pip installed inside the travis_script.sh bash script. Overall, not sure how travis, nosetests and coverage all fit together.
