Past week: 
> I finished the cesium website README with Alejandro. I also looked through the github repo on react walkthroughs - they seem very neat! I started doing the setup and converting the js to jsx.

Next week:
> I will continue working on the React walkthoughs. I would also like to get started on the Architectural Diagram when I finish the walkthroughs.

Issues:
> I am only a little familiar with javascript and react, but I am learning more about it through the setup.
