Past week: 
> I read some of the redux.js documentation and worked on the walkthroughs. I have them showing on the screen and moving, but I am working with Jie to refine some of the code

Next week:
> I will continue working on the React walkthoughs. I need to change the color of the background and text that is displayed on each walkthrough step. I think we are getting close!

Issues:
> I am having trouble changing background and descriptions for each step of the walkthrough. I feel like the changes I make in main.jsx are not reflecting when I run make.
