#Past Week
- Looked through pull requests and issues and tried to understand them.
- Attempted to find the indentation error in PR #2366 that was causing the Travis CI check to fail.
- Attempted to understand the logic of the code in Issue #2367 and figure out whether the problem is caused by a bug.
- Attempted Issue #2346.

##Next week
- Continue working on Issue #2346 or another issue.
- Might look through other PRs or issues.

##Issues
- Had trouble understanding the code involved in the issues and pull requests I looked through due to limited knowledge in the math behind it.
- Unsure of how to solve Issue #2346 since many of the functions feature.structure_tensor uses requires or outputs 2D arrays or points.
