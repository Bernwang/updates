#Past Week
- Worked on Issue #2346.
- Made suggested changes in PR #2364.

##Next week
- Continue working on Issue #2346.
- Try to figure out why the checks in PR #2351 are failing.
- Perhaps make more thorough tests for feature.structure_tensor and feature.corner_harris.

##Issues
- The Travis CI check for my PR #2351 is failing due to an indention error. I can't find where the indention error is though.
- Two tests for Issue #2346 are failing: test_normal_mode and test_uniform_mode even though all other tests pass.
