# Past Week
- finished debugging API doc writer and successsfully generated all sphinx documentation for files in music_feats/feaures, utils folders.(see my Github https://github.com/weiwzhang/music-features/tree/master/ for more info)

# Next Week
- start working on Travis-CI testing files
- peer code review: look into Travis-CI team's code 
- continue reading music-features/tutorials to understand more about the methodology of this research

# Issues
- IMPORTANT NOTE: midi package is having syntax errors, so it's commented out and abstained from usage for now (features/pitchextractor.py)
- local configuration problem: my Mac is missing certain Mac library that's stopping me from installing cortex (for now have commented out import cortex in files: utils/model_func.py, resposne_utils_fi.py). 
- need to double check for documentation clarity? any improvement needed?
