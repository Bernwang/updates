# Past Week
-After receiving all of the test files from Fatma, I was able to begin running tests on my local machine  
-Fixed an error where the code would call an array index that was a float  
# Next Week
-Continue fixing errors in the test code  
-The test cases should use smaller music samples so that GitHub can host the files and can utilize Travis-CI  
-Continue thinking about music features to implement
# Issues
-Some errors in the tests are hard to figure out. Will update on Slack as I progress
